    <h1>This is the <u>first heading</u></h1>
     <p>In paragraph one <i>I'll input some few basics</i><p><br>Starting from the first,, wait I'll have this image which you shouldn't see but,,,it's ok.<br>Here you go <img src="./img1.jpg"/>
     <div>See, I still got you in the truck. You're not lost!! </div>
     </p>
    <h2 style="background-color:green"><u>In this, lets have the 2nd thing!!</u></h2>
     <p>So far you've got my identity, but I've got something more for you.<br>Here is another mation you need.<a href="www.youtube.com"> Hey, just click on me here!‚úçÔ∏è‚Äç</a><br>Have you heard of the upside of my down? No worries, the complications you're seeing right now are no complications, but its only that I've got many unique layers that make who I amüòá.
     </p>
     <p>Having known that for today, let's have an overview of what we have incorporated in our brains.I know I have the few basics that makes me good to go on with the progress!, and as well a new beginning I've the heading where I should incorporate the title, and this I know is not displayed in the main page, but in the browser page. In the main page only what is in the body tag is seen there.<div>In the body page I can add an image by an image tag. Whatever image is to be added, before adding, the attribute (src=") preceeds/defines the image path. To link webpages, the attribute (href=") preceeds or defines the link. To start a new line, the break tag(br) is used. To create sections in the webpage , the division tag(div) is used. The image tag and the break tag are self closing.</div>
     </p>
     <p>Also learnt about attributes like <u>style</u> which is used to change the color and the font size.Take a look;
     </p>
     <p style="font-size:50%",style=color:red">This color is Red.<br>While here the font size is much bigger than throughout the paragraph.
